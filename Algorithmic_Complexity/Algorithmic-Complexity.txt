Efficiency In Programming:

Time => Time: We can compare which process takes less time to solve the problem. 

Space => Storage: We can compare which process takes less storage to solve the problem. 


Measure of time Efficiency:
 
Techniques:
1)Measuring time to execute:
   in this we can calculate time using time module from python and check what is the overall time the program take to print the output

2)Counting Operations involved:

3)Abstract notion of Order of growth:
